== Introduction

Part-time Manager (PTMan) is an application made for companies to manage their part timers and their respective working schedules. +
 +
PTMan comes with many useful features for employers to easily schedule their part times' working time slots. PTMan also allow the part timers to have more flexibility in choosing their own working schedules. +
 +
This user guide comes with comprehensive instructions and examples to help you get started using PTMan. +
 +
Sounds great? Jump straight to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Here are the steps required to get PTMan up and running on your computer:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PTMan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The graphical user interface (GUI) as seen in _<<fig-Startup>>_ should appear in a few seconds.
+

.Successful start up window
image::Ui_startup.png[width="790"]
.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

**You may refer to <<Features>> for more details of each command.**

=== First Time Setup For Employers
If you are using PTMan for the first time as an employer, you should change your admin password and the default outlet information by following these steps:

. Login to admin mode executing the command: `login pw/DEFAULT1` (`DEFAULT1` is the default admin password)
. Change the default admin password by executing the command: `changeadminpw pw/DEFAULT1 pw/NEW_PASSWORD pw/CONFIRM_NEW_PASSWORD`
. Change the default outlet information using: `editoutlet n/OUTLET_NAME h/OPERATING_HOURS c/CONTACT_NUMBER e/EMAIL` +
You may refer to <<Editing outlet information: `editoutlet`>> for more details.
[IMPORTANT]
Ensure that the outlet email is valid as it will be used to reset the admin password should you forget it.

[[Features]]
== Features

In this section, we will be introducing you to the various features of PTMan, and their respective  commands.
Our features would be split into 3 sub-sections, <<Shared Features>>, <<Employer Features>>, and <<Employee Features>>. +
Take note that for this user guide, our commands will follow the format as stated below.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, or none at all. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* For your convenience, many commands have an alias. +
eg. `list` and `l` will both show a list of all employees in PTMan.
====

=== Shared Commands
These commands can be executed by both employees and employers.
