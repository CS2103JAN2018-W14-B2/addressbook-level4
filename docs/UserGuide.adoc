[[Features]]
== Features

In this section, we will be introducing you to the various features of PTMan, and their respective  commands.
Our features would be split into 3 sub-sections, <<Shared Features>>, <<Employer Features>>, and <<Employee Features>>. +
Take note that for this user guide, our commands will follow the format as stated in Command Format below.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, or none at all. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
