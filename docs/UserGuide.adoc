== Introduction

Part-time Manager (PTMan) is for employers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing part-time employees*. More importantly, PTMan is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PTMan can get your employee management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== About
This user guide shows you how to get started using PTman +
 +
This user guide introduces you to the features PTMan have and leads you through with examples. +
 +
You are required to know how to use Java to run a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application. +

== Quick Start

Here are the steps required to get PTMan up and running on your computer:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PTMan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

*  Some example commands you can try:

** *`list`* : Lists all contacts.
** **`add`** `n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 s/0` : Adds an employee named `John Doe` to PTMan.
** **`delete`** `3` `pw/AdminPassword` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
